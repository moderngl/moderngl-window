# Changelog

## 3.0.0

* All callback functions now has an `on_` prefix meaning existing code will need updating. The old names was somewhat unambiguous and was a source of confusion. It also makes it easier to separate the callback functions from other methods.
  * `render` -> `on_render`
  * `resize` -> `on_resize`
  * `close` -> `on_close`
  * `iconify` -> `on_iconify`
  * `key_event` -> `on_key_event`
  * `mouse_position_event` -> `on_mouse_position_event`
  * `mouse_press_event` -> `on_mouse_press_event`
  * `mouse_release_event` -> `on_mouse_release_event`
  * `mouse_drag_event` -> `on_mouse_drag_event`
  * `mouse_scroll_event` -> `on_mouse_scroll_event`
  * `unicode_char_entered` -> `on_unicode_char_entered`
  * `files_dropped_event` -> `on_files_dropped_event`
* Pyrr is now replaced with PyGLM
* imgui is replaced with imgui-bundle
* Numpy version is no longer restricted

## 2.4.6

* Includes in shaders with quoted paths are now supported
* Renamed incorrect base window method name. `filed_dropped` -> `file_dropped_event`

* Fixed zoom sensitivity getter returning the wrong value
* Fixed several typos
* Bumped several dependencies to reasonable versions

Thanks to @Rafale25, @n3onUser, @erikstrand (Erik Strand),
@sheepman4267 and @dbs4261 (Daniel Simon) for contributions to this release.

## 2.4.1

* Experimental support for ffmpeg capture

## 2.4.0

Python 3.5 is no longer supported from this version.

New Features

* Experimental: New simple 2D text writer
* Various smaller improvements
* F11 now toggles fullscreen mode by default
* Window modules are now fetched from `moderngl_window.WINDOW_CLASSES`
  as a fallback. This is necessary in some environments.
* Absolute paths will now bypass all registered resource directories
  and load the specified file directly.

Bug Fixes

* Varying names can now be passed in when loading a program.
  Since the auto detection of out attributes is far from perfect
  this can be needed for more complex shaders.
* Missing python 3.9 classifier in setup.py
* SDL2 window should now also process since change events
* GLFW: Fixed some incorrect key mappings
* Fixed an issue with timers causing the first frame to have negative frame time
* Fixed a pixel scale issue in the imgui integration. This was especially
  an issue with tiling window managers

## 2.3.0

New Features

* Added a simple Scheduler (Thanks to @Leterax)
* Added support for toggling fullscreen
* Added support for setting window icon
* `TextureDescription` now supports flipping the texture on x and y
* The pyglet window now supports dragging in files
* Added `BaseWindow.convert_window_coordinates` for converting mouse coordinates
* Added more examples

Bug Fixes

* BaseWindow now references WindowConfig using a weakref
* Overriding the timer in `run_window_config` had no effect
* Numpad keys was not mapped correctly in some instances
* Timers should return 0 when not started
* glfw window close callback did now work
* glfw now respects content scaling on windows and X11
* Added some missing methods in docs
* Fixed various doc typos

## 2.2.3

* imgui integration no longer relies on pyopengl
* Bug: Properly parse `out` attributes with layout qualifiers
* Bug: Do not cache system shaders at module level.
  We now cache them in the context to better support multiple windows.
* Bug: OrbitCameraWindow - Fixed radians/degree issue
* Bug: A window can now be closed from inside `render()`

## 2.2.2

* Fixed several issues causing the window close callback not being called
* Fixed incorrect mouse button mapping in mouse drag events

## 2.2.1

* imgui renderer now supports moderngl textures. This opens up for both
  displaying images and animated framebuffer textures into imgui.
* Scene: Fixed several issues related to shader assigning based on material properties.
  This especially affected wavefront/obj files.
* OrbitCamera: Fixed translation issue (@Leterax)
* OrbitCamera: Now using degrees instead of radians (@Leterax)
* Bumped pyglet version to minimum 1.5.6. This version
  solves several issue with window events for MacBooks with Touch Bar

## 2.2.0

* `WindowConfig` now supports overriding the default arugment parser.
  A classmethod `add_arguments` can be implemented to add additional
  arguments. The parsed arguments are available in `self.argv`
* Added in `Scene.draw_wireframe` rendering a scene in wire frame mode
* `Scene.draw_bbox` now support passing in a `color`
* `Scene` should now have better support for all the vertex formats
  wavefront/obj files may have.
* Addded `WindowConfig.clear_color` attribute so uses can control the
  clear color of the screen. The value can be set to `None` to
  disable screen clearing (@Leterax)
* Added `OrbitCamera` (@Leterax)
* Allow setting camera rotation (@Leterax)
* `VAO` should now give better feedback if the buffers and program
  attributes are not compatible
* `ModernGLRenderer` (imgui renderer) should not rely on moderngl-window (@minuJeong)
* `Scene` should now cache default shaders internally so they are not loaded
  for every scene
* Several typos in docs (@dawid-januszkiewicz)
* `WindowConfig.load_compute_shader` missing in docs
* Bumped pygame to `2.0.0.dev10`

Thanks to @Leterax, @minuJeong and @dawid-januszkiewicz for the contributions to this release
and @mtbouchard for input on `WindowConfig` and `Scene` changes.

## 2.1.1

### Improvements

* Optimized the imgui renderer using `ctypes` instead of `numpy` for handling vertex data (@aforren1)
* Added support for ALT key modifier in all window backends and other improvements to key handling (@OKaluza)
* `WindowConfig` now supports a `fullscreen` attribute

Thanks to Alex Forrence (@aforren1) and Owen Kaluza (@OKaluza) for the contributions to this release.

## 2.1.0

New Features

* moderngl and moderngl-window integration for imgui thought the pyimgui project.
  This is fairly experimental and the rendered should probably be moved to the pyimgui project soon

> Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies)

* Compute shader support. `WindowConfig.load_compute_shader` and added `compute_shader` parameter for `ProgramDescription`.
* Shaders now support `#include` up to a maximum of 100 levels
* Added support for gif anim. This can be loaded as a `Texture` or `TextureArray`
* Added support for loading cube maps
* `WindowConfig.run()` shortcut
* Each window backend now has a `name` property so the user can easily detect what window type they are given
* `WindowConfig` now as a `vsync` property so the user can easily control this from python code
* Scene: New methods to find materials and node by name

Slightly Breaking Changes

* All windows now use 0 samples (MSAA) by default. The default `samples = 4` caused way too much issues
  for people with older integrated gpus and when doing headless rendering when multisampling is not supported.

Bug fixes

* Fixed several issues with glft2 scenes and object orientation
* pyglet window: Fixed incorrect mouse position on retina screens and windows
  with pixel ratio > 1.
* sdl2: mouse press/release events was reversed
* pygame2: Fix broken mouse wheel reading
* glfw: Incorrect mapping of BACKSPACE key
* glfw: Fixed an issue not setting vsync properlyÂ¨
* headless: We now call `ctx.finish()` in `swap_buffers`
* Shader errors should now report the error line more accurately
* Various typo fixes

## 2.0.5

Improvements

* Windows now has an `exit_key` property that can be used to change
  or disable the exit key. This key is `ESCAPE` by default and can
  be disabled by setting the property to `None`. This is useful
  for users that don't want the default exit key behavior.
* Log consumed glerrors after context creation as warnings

Bug fixes

* Pyglet mouse coordinates was translated wrong in cases were the
  framebuffer size is larger that then window. The mouse position
  should always use window coordinates.
* VAOs should now properly support 64 bit floats / dvec
* VAOs should be better at detecting/ignoring built in attributes
* `Camera.look_at` had broken input validation when passing in a vector
* Various typos in docstrings

## 2.0.4

Resolved an issue with version constraints causing some dependencies to install pre-release versions

## 2.0.3

* Missing `WindowConfig.close` method and support for close callback for all window types
* Bug: KeyboardCamera's matrix is now always returned as a 32bit floats
* Bug: Projection3D's matrix is now always returned as a 32bit floats
* Example cleanup and improvements

## 2.0.2

* Bug: An `INVALID_ENUM` glerror triggered after querying context info is now consumed.

## 2.0.1

Bug fixes

* SDL2 window now allows highdpi framebuffers when available
* pygame2 window should only initialize the display module

## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

* `mouse_position_event` signature has changed from `(x, y)` to `(x, y, dx, dy)`.
  This means you will also be getting the relative position change.
* `mouse_drag_event` signature has changed from `(x, y)` to `(x, y, dx, dy)`.
  This means you will also be getting the relative position change.
* `KeyboardCamera.rot_state` now takes dx and dy instead of x and y

### Improvements

* Python 3.8 support (PySide2 will take a few more months. SDL2 has issues on windows)
* Added pygame2 window
* Added window callback `iconify` for all window types that will be called
  when a window is minimized or restored
* Window property `mouse_exclusivity` added for all window types.
  When enabled the mouse cursor is invisible and mouse position changes
  are only reported through the dx and dy values.
* Window property `size` is now assignable for all window types
* Window property `position` is now assignable for all window types
* Window property `title` is now assignable for all window types
* Window property `cursor` is now assignable for all window types
* The `KeyboardCamera` class should now be better at reducing the
  chance of rotation and movement popping
* All windows now properly separate viewport calculations when
  using fixed and free viewport (derived from window size)
* The window `aspect_ratio` property should always return
  the a value based on if the aspect ratio is fixed or free
* Added window `fixed_aspect_ratio` property so users can freely
  control this after window creation

## 1.5.2

* Added window property `position` for getting and setting window position for all window types
* Added window properties: `viewport_size`, `viewport_width`, `viewport_height`
* Upgraded dependency for tkinter window. `pyopengltk>=0.0.3`
* Loosened up most of the requirements
* Bug: Missing call to `tk.destroy()` in tk window

## 1.5.1

* Upgraded dependency for tkinter window. `pyopengltk==0.0.2`.

## 1.5.0

* Added experimental support for tkinter window. Relies on
  Jon Wright's pyopengltk package: <https://github.com/jonwright/pyopengltk>.
  Currently only supports windows and linux, but that might change
  in the future.
* KeyboardCamera: Exposed `mouse_sensitivity`, `velocity` and `projection` attributes
* Various missing docstring and docstring improvements
* Various missing type hints

## 1.4.0

* Added support for mouse_drag events for all window types
* Added support for unicode_char_entered (text input) for all windows
* Added support for mouse wheel events for all window types

## 1.3.0

* Fixed several issue related to python 3.5 support
* Upgraded to pywavefront 1.2.x

* Renamed some inconsistent parameter names in the codebase
* Complete overhaul of docstrings in the entire codebase
* Added missing type hints
* Revived the STL loader
* Documentation
* Added `moderngl_window.__version__` attribute

## 1.2.0

* GL errors during window creation is now consumed. This is to avoid confusion when this state is set in the rendering loop.
* Default anisotropy for textures loaders is now 1.0 (disabled, isotropy)
* Mipmaps are no longer generated by default. You must explicitly enable this in parameters.
* WindowConfig.load_texture_2d now exposes more parameters
* WindowConfig.load_texture_array now exposes more parameters
* WindowConfig.load_scene now exposes more parameters
* Texture loaders supports specifying mipmap levels

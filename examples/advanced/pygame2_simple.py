Based partly on BlubberQuark's blog:
https://blubberquark.tumblr.com/post/185013752945/using-moderngl-for-post-processing-shaders-with

Basic example showing how to efficiently render a pygame surface with moderngl
in the most efficient way. We include alpha channel as well since this
is a very common use case.

This involves to steps:
* Copy the surface data from system memory into graphics memory (texture)
* Render this texture to the screen with some simple geometry

There are two common ways to get the pixel data from a pygame surface:
* pygame.image.tostring(surface, "RGBA", ...)
* surface.get_view("1")

We're using get_view() here because it's faster and more efficient.
In fact about 700+ times faster than tostring() since get_view() doesn't
copy or transform the data in any way.
This however comes with a caveat:

* The raw data of the surface is in BGRA format instead of RGBA so
  we need to set a swizzle on the OpenGL texture to swap the channels.
  This just means OpenGL will swap the channels when reading the data.
  It's pretty much a "free" operation.
* OpenGL are storing textures upside down so we usually need to flip
  the texture. The raw surface data is not flipped, but we can flip
  the texture coordinates instead.

To be as explicit as possible we're not using any shortcuts and include
our own shader program and geometry to render the texture to the screen.
In other words: we are using none of the shortcuts in moderngl-window.

Also note that this example can easily be tweaked to only use RGB data
instead of RGBA if alpha channel is not needed.

Other notes:
* We don't use any projection in this example working directly in
  normalized device coordinates. Meaning we are working in the range
  [-1, 1] for both x and y.
* Texture coordinates are in the [0.0, 1.0] range.
